# SunRuikang

**Hi there!**

I am a college student at Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University. I am studying pharmaceutical sciences here since 2019.

I am (probably, at least I think so) a tech otaku. My hobbies include science (chemistry and biology experiments), technology (Coding -- Python and front end, RaspberryPi, HAM radio -- my callsign is BI4LWT) and gaming (Genshin Impact, LOL, CSGO). I am a mad fan of open source, really enjoy replacing commercial softwares with open source one. So I am also learning advanced programming skills to contribute to open source community.

## Skills

Computer aided & AI drug design (CADD & AIDD) -- GROMACS, PyMOL,KNIME, RDKit

Amateur Python engineer -- spider, plotting etc (for non production environment)

Website maintenance and SEO -- frontend, hexo, Django and a little PHP

Hardware -- RasPi, ESP8266, SDR, still learning RISC-V
